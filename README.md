## üìò TASK - 1: Introduction to Cyber Security and Setting up Lab Environment

### üîê What is Cyber Security?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, programs, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access.

It involves methods, processes, tools, and behaviors to protect systems from cyberattacks and ensure safe, trustworthy digital operations.

### ‚ùì Why Do We Need Cyber Security?

- Protect personal and business data  
- Ensure safe digital transactions  
- Prevent cyber-crimes and attacks  
- Build trust in technology  
- Protect the economy and national security

## üîß Fundamentals of Cybersecurity

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CIA Triad

The three core principles of cybersecurity:

- **C ‚Äì Confidentiality**: Protecting information from unauthorized access.
- **I ‚Äì Integrity**: Ensuring accuracy and trustworthiness of data.
- **A ‚Äì Availability**: Ensuring data/services are accessible to authorized users.

#### ‚úî Examples:
- **Confidentiality**: WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption, Gmail login with password.
- **Integrity**: Preventing tampering in bank transactions or exam marks.
- **Availability**: Banking apps working during peak times, backups during DDoS attacks.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication and Authorization

#### üîë Authentication
Verifying identity before allowing access.

**Examples**:
- Username & Password  
- Biometrics  
- OTP

**Types**:
- Something you know (Password)
- Something you have (OTP device)
- Something you are (Biometrics)

#### ‚úÖ Authorization
Determining what actions a user can perform.

**Examples**:
- Student can only view results  
- Admin can add/remove users  

**Types**:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Cybersecurity

| Type              | Description                                    | Tools/Methods                         |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Network Security  | Protects internal networks                     | Firewalls, IDS/IPS                    |
| Application Sec.  | Secures apps and software                      | Code reviews, secure coding          |
| Information Sec.  | Protects data                                   | Access control, encryption           |
| Operational Sec.  | Policies & procedures for secure ops           | Access management                     |
| Cloud Security    | Secures cloud-stored data                      | IAM, encryption, access control       |
| Endpoint Security | Protects end-user devices                      | Antivirus, firewalls                  |

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Common Cyber Threats

- **Malware**: Viruses, worms, spyware  
- **Phishing**: Fake emails/messages to steal data  
- **Ransomware**: Locks system, demands ransom  
- **Man-in-the-middle**: Intercepts communication  
- **SQL Injection**: Manipulates databases  
- **DDoS Attack**: Overloads server with traffic  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Encryption üîí

**Definition**: Converting plaintext to unreadable ciphertext to prevent unauthorized access.

**Importance**:
- Secures communication  
- Ensures privacy  
- Essential for banking, healthcare, etc.

**Types**:
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key for encrypt/decrypt (e.g., AES, DES)  
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Public & private keys (e.g., RSA, ECC)

**Examples**:
- HTTPS websites  
- WhatsApp, Signal  
- PGP Email  
- Cloud Storage encryption  

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Firewall

A firewall monitors and controls network traffic based on rules.

**Purpose**:
- Blocks unauthorized access  
- Filters malware and attacks  
- Logs activity for audit

**Types**:
- **Network Firewall (Hardware)** ‚Äì Routers, Cisco ASA  
- **Software Firewall** ‚Äì Windows Defender  
- **Web App Firewall (WAF)** ‚Äì Protects against SQL injection, XSS
